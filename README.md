## Setting up the environment
To set up our environment we need to follow some initial steps. 

### Operational System

You will need an **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)**.

### Kernel Prerequisites
In order for us to run everything accordingly it is necessary that the kernel of your physical machine (dom0) be **linux-image-5.4.0-81-lowlatency**
If your kernel is not this one, install it using this command:

```
sudo apt install linux-headers-5.4.0-81-lowlatency linux-image-unsigned-5.4.0-81-lowlatency
```

Reboot your machine and, on the GRUB page, choose that you want to boot the system using the newly installed kernel. Check kernel version with ```uname -r```

### Xen Configuration
